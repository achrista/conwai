Construction with AI - Predict construction revenue by fuel consumption

## Summary

For construction contractors it is important to know their expected revenue early. In roadworks or special foundations, the work is done with big equipment with a lot of diesel consumption. Analysing the engineâ€™s telematic data might provide a reliable prediction of revenues.

## Background

The construction industry is notoriously slow in embracing new technology. However, the possibilities of using AI methods in the sector are vast. Predicting revenue is very important for the financial stability of small and big contractors alike to plan for example the cash-flow of the organisation or the logistics of resources.
In sectors where the performance depends primarily on major diesel driven equipment, the correlation between revenue and diesel consumption should be strong.

## How is it used?

The results of the models can be an integral part of the financial controlling systems of the contractor. 

## Data sources and AI methods

Each major modern equipment has basic data like fuel consumption available via telematic systems. For older equipment it can be added without high costs. Collecting the data through the various sources at OEMs or directly from the equipment and normalizing of the data should be part of this project.  

The revenue achieved with the equipment is required for training of the model. 

The use of particular AI methods will be decided after analysing the available data. 

## Challenges

Access to the data of the equipment is sometimes limited by manufacturers. The exchange of revenue data between contractors operating in the same market might not be possible.  

## What next?

The prediction might be interesting not only for the construction industry, but as well for others like harvesting, taxis or transport related trades. Adding other available data like temperature or precipitation can improve the model. 

It is intended to develop a community to share ideas, data and code.
